October 30, 2014:

I understand the requirements as follows:
- I need a place to collect matlab and simulink courses offered around the world
- I need a form to enter the following:
  - Course Title (required)
  - Course Description
  - Course Image URL
  - Course URL (coursera url, edx url, etc.) (required)
  - Course Source (does it come from coursera, edx or elsewhere) (required)
  title and URL and source required, description doesn't have to exist
- I must be able to save the course after entering its details in a form
- If I click on a course card, I see a single course view
- I should have the ability to search for a course, which will return all courses that fit a particular search query in a card layout format (see matlab examples to do this)
- Code should be testable
